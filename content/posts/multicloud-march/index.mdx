Time flies. 90 days ago was [my first day at Faction](/cloud-data-services-ahead).

So, in this post I wanted to capture some thoughts over the past 90 days. While I have more thoughts that are topical, I'll use this post to reflect on my multicloud immersion.

# Starting in a new role

Keith Townsend [@CTOAdvisor](https://twitter.com/CTOAdvisor/status/1369342632883851266) raised a question on Twitter for anyone that joined a new company with a new team in the past year. I replied with a short list of what I've been up to in the past 90 days.

## Listening

There's a saying about being humble when you join a new company because a lot happened before you arrived. I agree.

## Weekly 1:1

I still believe that there is no excuse for not spending time with team members that you serve every week. Servant leadership is a commitment to being available.

## Zoom Office Hours

Standing up a Zoom office hours block and customizing the waiting room is a useful tactic. Protecting time on your calendar for ad-hoc or drop in discussion is also a good tactic.

## Starts Stops Keeps

Whether you call it *Starts, Stops, Keeps* or *Stop, Start, Continue* the approach is to have a simple way to gather [feedback and reflection](https://hbr.org/2011/08/three-questions-for-effective-feedback).

## Deeds Needs Bleeds

I picked up deeds, needs, and bleeds at Nortel. At the time, I recall that overhead slides were during the age of overhead projector transparencies.

Deeds were the things to celebrate as accomplishments no matter what it might be.

Needs were the things that required assistance for the clearinghouse of potential helpers around you when the team came together.

Bleeds were a way to share a lightweight post-mortem and share failures that might help others learn from a mistake or logic miss.

Oddly enough, bleeds are super useful ways to *"avoid making the same mistake thrice"*.

Thrice? Yep.

One mistake is an event.
Two mistakes is a line.
Three mistakes is a trend.

## Published C7s and 3HAGs

Perhaps you've read Mastering the Rockefeller Habits or Scaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It...and Why the Rest Don't (Mastering the Rockefeller Habits 2.0) by Verne Harnish.

If you haven't you might enjoy it as a distillation of several other business books and frameworks you've been exposed to in a single book. If you apply the basics from the book you can even put together [a strategic plan that fits on one page](https://blog.growthinstitute.com/scale-up-blueprint/opsp-one-page-strategic-plan).

The C7 or Column 7 is where you get to focus on accountability in terms of key performance indicators, metrics, priorities, critical numbers, and hopefully that's more than enough for a 90 day period. Again, the goal is accountability and if there are goals they should be specific measurable attainable relevant and time bound aka the SMART mnemonic acronym.

Then there is thinking long term or thinking bigger. Big Hairy Audacious goals or BHAGs were something I remembered carrying in my wallet during the .com boom. Today, I tend to favor 3 year BHAG or 3HAGs.

## Capturing Processes and Decision Logs

As I've written here before, [The Perfect Team](https://fudge.org/the-perfect-team) is one to do it, one to write it down, and one to think ahead. So, in a typical company in a typical time there is bound to be tribal knowledge that simply escaped being written down somewhere.

So, when scaling up a company, a documentation culture can help with all the days that follow.

## Succession Planning

Even if these were not pandemic times, it would be important to have a succession plan. My early personal and professional life gave me multiple examples of what happens when people leave and life and work must go on without them.

## FYSA FYA

Decision making frameworks are one way to avoid what I believe was a fun Jim Barksdale quote:

"If we're dealing with fact, great. If we're dealing with opinions, let's go with mine" :smile:

Gathering of facts to compile alternatives as stack ranked choices to seek a commitment of of precious capital is a time tested tradition in business.

## Time Bounded Agenda Team Meetings

Have you ever heard the one about the difference between a SNL skit and a Monty Python skit? The latter has an ending.

# Multicloud Rosetta Stone

Cloud service providers are growing in number. So too are their product marketing teams. 

There are only so many ways to describe or brand what are often very similar things. Yet, the naming continues to stay on... brand.
