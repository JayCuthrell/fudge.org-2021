I've had a chance to think more about the past few months that for many might seem as though it has lasted for years not just months. This post is about thinking remotely.

First, I want to be clear that I'm incredibly *fortunate* and *priveledged* to be able to even had the spare time to think let alone write this post. See also: It's easy for me to say this as a long time technology consultant that has spent the majority of my career in telecommunications as well as information and communications technology (ICT) being a "road warrior" operating far outside of traditional office settings.

Second, if you work with your hands making things or various service industries outside traditional office setting, I may not have much to share other than my respect and profound sympathy. So, if that sounds like you reading this -- thank you in advance.

Third, if you are reading this and fortunate enough to still have a job that _was in an office setting doing knowledge work_, the sudden shift to working away from the office is probably jarring. Patterns have changed and I'd like to share a few words about thinking remotely.

# Pattern Before

An incredibly simplified view of the pattern before might look like this:

- waking
- regular life
- commuting
- arrival at the office
- contributing in a formal office setting with cubicals, open seating, collaboration spaces, meeting rooms, break rooms, etc.
- departure from the office
- commuting
- regular life
- sleeping

In prior years, there were seemingly endless posts and articles describing how to live your best regular life. Those quality of life pieces might seem quaint or illogical at this present time.

# Pattern After

Likewise, an incredibly simplified view of the pattern after might look like this:

- waking
- _irregular_ life
- contributing remotely most likely from a dedicated home office, spare room, spare table, couch, back seat of a vehicle, or other ad hoc setups never intended to be permanent, etc.
- _irregular_ life
- sleeping

Once regular life went away it was replaced with _irregular_ life. Even then, fitting some quality of life into the pattern is probably harder to fit in regardless.

# Thoughts for Today

Typical company reactions might range from forming a team, panel, or formally assigning a leader to come up with a plan for getting remote work to, well, work. While I'm not advocating a dedicated [Head of Remote Work](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/09/head-of-remote-work-jobs/) needs to exist within the job family definitions of an human resources there will be a need to generalize the culture of remote work even more in the future.

Next, I'll focus on four key areas of thinking remotely: spaces, networks, sensing, and sustainability 

## Adaptation and Improvisation 

## Connectivity and Community

## Presence and Partitions

## Productivity and Balance
