The screenshot above is from a trip to Tokyo back in 2012. I had never experienced the kind of network performance -- true 3G performance.

Fast forward to 2020. Now it's 5G making headlines and 6G futures are ahead if you subscribe to [futurecasting](https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2020/9/tech-trends-innovation-ericsson-research) from companies with established history.

# What was social telecom in 2010?

Roughly a decade ago, I authored a blog post about what I referred to as [Social Telecom in 2010](/social-telecom/). In a nutshell, much of my world view and career had been shaped by telecommunications and I was reflecting on what I saw happening at SxSW Interactive, Film, and Music conferences.

For example, when I created my first [Twitter](/on-twitter/) account in 2007 it was clear to be that mashing up SMS and Web was going to be interesting. Look back fondly to when SMS short code 40404 was fun (and periodically unintentionally hilarious when folks sent things to it in error) and more reliable than 3G connectivity.

Indeed, [being part of Startup Weekend 3 Atlanta in 2009 with Justin and Clay was fun](https://justindawkins.com/2009/11/gomodo-helps-you-quickly-find-events-near-you/). Looking back, Twilio was a sponsor for multiple Startup Weekend events that year including the Atlanta team using the Twilio API that ultimately won.

Good times. [Great community](https://www.flickr.com/photos/timdorr/albums/72157622805303294).

Back then, the web on mobile devices was slow by modern comparisons but it was mobile. There were apps being created that reolved around what was increasingly being referred to as social media. 

Looking back, it's not shocking to see that I applied a lens of what was being developed in and around the consumer grade Internet experience from laptops to the latest generation of mobile devices. My perspectives were from a service provider point of view.

# What is social telecom today in 2020?

Well, for one thing, the original @ComcastCares Twitter use case of days gone by is almost universally accessible for major brands now. Engagement is now table stakes.

Today, solutions from SaaS vendors that fuse CRM, social platform conduits, sentiment analysis, and more are featured prominiently as brands seek out every possible channel to engage more deeply with customers, subscribers, and users of products and services.

# What is social telecom going to be in 2030?

Q: In 2030, will own the cloud?

A: An algal bloom of diversified service providers aligned to Balkanized geopolitical boundaries terrestrially and a growing number of solar system federated systems of placement.

Today's economics and not necessarily tomorrow's economics:

* 6G is incubating in the minds of marketplace leaders as their 5G rollouts and storytelling ramps towards assumed ubiquity.
* Friends and family plans will take on new meaning that are more social constructs than they are cleverly marketed billing construct today.

* There will be a precipitous drop in memory costs and the future of egregious egress fees for cloud hosting providers is going to shift from awkward to completely unjustifiable.
* Cloud egress fees are the 2020s version of long distance charges from the 1990s.

Considering the proliferation of BMaaS, edge, and other variants on a marketing theme of select your control point — this is quite timely. https://twitter.com/techmeme/status/1314275875953635328

Pressure on purely asymmetrical performing facilities based broadband providers will continue but only in the most competitive US markets. This pressure (combined with increased remote work use cases) will extend to CGNAT and likely push most US markets into IPv6 by 2030. https://twitter.com/Techmeme/status/1314336261281259525

Q: Is the conferencing market saturated?

A: No. This is only the beginning.
Startups will iterate consumer accessible capabilities by combining intuitive UX/UI and "neural engine" filters with affordable devices to approximate the @Cisco @TelePresence wow factor circa 2011.

My $0.02 x 6: SpaceX Starlink (beta pricing) is...
1) Reasonable
2) Comparable to @ViasatInternet tiers
3) Going to force @HughesNet to reach its nadir / pivot
4) Challenging terrestrial facilities based broadband
5) Going to compete with Kuiper
6) Not yet a OneWeb metaphor

The progression from Reddit AMA to Cameo PMA AMTSA (ask me to say anything) will be fascinating as the deep fakes technology is connected with likeness brand licensing for authorized automated markets for applied celebrity pantomime and dialog.

Coming soon: :robot_face:
@SubstackInc to @WordPress to @Twitter to @threadreaderapp to @awscloud Polly to @anchor to @rev to @SubstackInc tool chain with integrations to @zapier @IFTTT @MicrosoftTeams and @SlackHQ

In case anyone was wondering why @zoom_us brought in the @KeybaseIO team... hint: it wasn't to #HODL $XLM

During the rise of facilities based broadband deployment, “edging out” strategy workshops for protected rural ILECs within the US was commonplace. The fear was MSOs would add door hangers to foment turnover so turnabout was fair play.
ET is the new high ground competitor.

Watch companies previously branded as “software defined” or “intent based” across networking and storage that offer “telemetry, “watcher”, or “reporter” functionality. Marketing will pivot to emphasize an “observability” angle more than an underlying technology investment.

Eventually, there will be a market for fully electric hermetically sealed living compartment sized vehicles. Just look at /r/priusdwellers to understand how minimalist nomadic lifestyles are connected to car culture through an overnight AC and generator combo on wheels.

If you follow hobbyist #RVLife #minimalism #DigitalNomads streams on social platforms, you'll immediately understand why an all-electric E-Transit from @Ford may fundamentally alter the future of remote work and potentially shape future census data and domicile law.

# Who will pay for this and how?

On a long enough timeline, we might one day become civil enough to @expensify our @soylent and be reimbursed through @coinbase where each transaction is rounded up to infuse a @gofundme surplus that augments grand projects outside the established norm of universal basic income.

Flashback to when the Twitter "SUL" happened in 2009.
Years later, when Google+ was a thing, I remember becoming way to popular way too fast because I was added to a similar kind of list in 2011. Thankfully, Google+ went the way of Buzz / Wave / etc...

Now imagine TikTok grade influencer economics like those from Gibson's Idoru.

# What requires careful attention?

Technology is just the response to a perceived need.

“A DCGAN hyper-localized psyops campaign can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. -- Mark Twain"
-- Michael Scott

AI/ML and taste squelch knobs will need to be present because the streams will be far beyond what we assume is useful or manually manageable. There is a low chance of success if SRE skills are required to simply pay attention to the news.

i.e.

This new pattern seems to be... an old pattern.:thinking_face:
1) Monetize a podcast/channel/etc
2) Say/write/do something outrageous (troll)
3) Wait for it to be noticed by the outrage prone
4) Engage based on greatest amplification potential
5) Deep link for rage subscribes
6) PROFIT
7) :repeat:

Fun re-reading exercise.
1) Re-read the "Perspectives on Harmful Speech Online".
2) Try to forget it was published in 2017.
3) Imagine this was published in 2023.
4) Imagine Internet balkanization in 2027.
