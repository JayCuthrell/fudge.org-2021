What's interesting about Tumblr? For me it is something I played with after I played with Posterous and I never saw it as a platform to start from since I had already been dinking around with WordPress.

I've created and deleted accounts on Tumblr many many times. This is sort of how I've treated Facebook over the years as well. I had been connecting to Tumblr via IFTTT but even that service has waned in appeal to me lately.

I think that's because apps have centered around getting a push menu in place vs. trying to be the sole destination. That means I can publish something as a shared item that goes to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and even Tumblr.

This one?

I'm doing it by sending an email to a hashed email address at Tumblr.com. I remember there were entire web publishing software companies predicated on this concept back in 1997. The more things change... the more they stay the same.

_(update: horrible horrible formatting when using email plain text...)_
